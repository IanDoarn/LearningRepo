# FizzBuzz

We all know this one!

Write a program that prints the integers from   1   to   100   (inclusive).

 - for multiples of three,   print   Fizz     (instead of the number)
 - for multiples of five,   print   Buzz     (instead of the number)
 - for multiples of both three and five,   print   FizzBuzz     (instead of the number)
